#*GPS Reflections*

Git concepts that I was struggling with prior to my GPS:

* I had a lot of confusion around pushing and pulling in Git Hub and in the differences between cloning and pulling a repository to my computer.

Concepts that were clarified during GPS:

* The above question was certainly clarified, also a lot of stuff regarding multiple users working off the same project in Git Hub.

Questions I asked my pair and guide:

* I asked whats the difference between Git pull fetch and merge were.
* I also asked how I would resolve a merge conflict.

What still confuses me about Git:

* Honestly I feel like I have a general grasp of the concept but I'm still a little shaky about all aspects of the practical application.

How was my first experience pairing in a GPS?

* It was great, I was nervous going in but I thought it went very smoothly.
